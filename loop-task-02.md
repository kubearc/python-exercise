# Python Task â€“ Number Pattern

This Python program prints a simple **number pattern** using loops.

---

## Task

Write a Python program that prints the following pattern:

```
```
1
12
123
1234
12345

```
```
---

## ðŸ’¡ Hints

- Use a **for loop** to control the number of rows.  
- Inside the loop, use another **for loop** (or string join) to print numbers from **1 to i**.  
- Use `end=""` in the `print()` function so the numbers appear **side by side**.

## âœ… Expected Output

```
```
1
12
123
1234
12345
```
````

## ðŸŽ¯ Concepts Practiced

* **Nested loops** (`for` inside another `for`)
* **Number sequence printing**
* **Using `end=""` in print statements**

---

âœ… A great exercise to strengthen your understanding of **loops** and **pattern printing** in Python!
