#  Python Test Task â€“ Library Management System

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that simulates a **library management system** using both **Python basics** and **OOP concepts**.

## Requirements

1. Create a class `Book` with:
   - Attributes: `title`, `author`, `available` (default = True).  
   - Method: `display_info()` â†’ prints book details.  

2. Create a class `Library` with:
   - Attribute: `books` (a list to store book objects).  
   - Methods:  
     - `add_book(book)` â†’ adds a book to the library.  
     - `show_books()` â†’ displays all books.  
     - `borrow_book(title)` â†’ changes availability if the book is borrowed.  

3. In the main program:
   - Create a few books and add them to the library.  
   - Use a loop to display a menu:

     2. Borrow a book  
     3. Exit
