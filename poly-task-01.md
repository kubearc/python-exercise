## Problem Statement
Demonstrate **polymorphism** in Python using a base class and multiple subclasses that override the same method.

---

##  Requirements
1. Create a **base class** `Animal` with a method `speak()`.
2. Create at least **three subclasses** (`Dog`, `Cat`, `Cow`) that **override** the `speak()` method.
   - `Dog` â†’ `"Woof!"`
   - `Cat` â†’ `"Meow!"`
   - `Cow` â†’ `"Moo!"`
3. Write a function `animal_sound(animal)` that takes any object of type `Animal` and calls its `speak()` method.
4. Demonstrate **polymorphism** by passing different animal objects to the function.

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Output

```
Woof!
Meow!
Moo!
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Concept Highlight

* **Polymorphism** means *many forms*.
* In this example, the `animal_sound()` function works differently depending on the object (`Dog`, `Cat`, `Cow`) passed to it.
* This shows how the **same interface** (`speak()`) can have **different implementations**.
