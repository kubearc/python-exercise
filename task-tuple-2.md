##  Task 1: Basic Tuple Operations

### Problem

You are given the following tuple:

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "mango", "banana")
```

Perform these tasks:

1. Access first and last fruit.
2. Print the first 3 fruits as a new tuple.
3. Concatenate with `("grape", "kiwi")`.
4. Repeat the tuple twice.
5.  add `"orange"`, to tuple.

## Task 2: Access, Update & Unpack Tuples

### Problem

Given:

```python
student = ("Alice", 21, "Computer Science", "Delhi")
```

1. Print **name** and **city**.
2. change age â†’ `22`,
3.  add `"Python"`.
4. Unpack into variables and print each separately.


## Task 3: Loop, Join & Multiply Tuples

### Problem

Given:

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
letters = ("A", "B", "C")
```

1. Print all numbers using `for` loop.
2. Print all letters using `while` loop.
3. Join the two tuples.
4. Repeat `letters` 3 times and `numbers` 2 times.
