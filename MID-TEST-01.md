# Task â€“ Banking System

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that simulates a simple **banking system** using **classes, objects, loops, and conditionals**.

---

## Requirements

1. Create a class `BankAccount` with:
   - Attributes: `account_holder`, `balance` (default = 0).  
   - Methods:  
     - `deposit(amount)` â†’ adds money to balance.  
     - `withdraw(amount)` â†’ subtracts money if sufficient balance.  
     - `check_balance()` â†’ prints current balance.  

2. In the main program:
   - Create one `BankAccount` object.  
   - Use a **looped menu** to perform operations:  
     1. Deposit Money  
     2. Withdraw Money  
     3. Check Balance  
     4. Exit
