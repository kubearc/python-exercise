# Python Task – List Methods Practice

## Task
Write a Python program to **demonstrate different list methods** step by step.

---

## Requirements

1. Create a list of numbers and a list of strings.
2. Perform the following operations:
   - `append()` → Add a new element at the end.
   - `insert()` → Add an element at a specific index.
   - `extend()` → Combine two lists.
   - `remove()` → Remove a specific element.
   - `pop()` → Remove element by index.
   - `sort()` → Sort numbers in ascending order.
   - `reverse()` → Reverse the list.
   - `clear()` → Remove all elements.

##  Example Output

```
Original numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40]
After append: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
After insert: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50]
After extend: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 'apple', 'banana']
After remove: [10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 'apple', 'banana']
After pop: [10, 15, 30, 50, 'apple', 'banana']
Sorted numbers: [10, 15, 30, 50]
Reversed: ['banana', 'apple', 50, 30, 15, 10]
After clear: []
```
