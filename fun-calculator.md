## Task: Calculator using Functions

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

1. Defines the following functions:
   - returns the sum of two numbers.  
   - returns the difference of two numbers.  
   - returns the product of two numbers.  
   - returns the division of two numbers (handle division by zero).  

2. In the `main()` function:
   - Ask the user to enter two numbers.  
   - Ask the user to choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
   - Call the respective function and print the result.
