#  Python Practice Task

## Task: Array Operations Playground

###  Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

1. Starts with an **empty array**.  
2. Lets the user **perform operations** on the array using functions and built-in methods:  
   - add an element at the end.  
   - add at a specific position.  
   - delete the first occurrence of a value.  
   - remove the last element.  
   - sort the array.  
   - reverse the array.  

3. Print the updated array after each operation.  
```
### Example Output
```

Initial Array: \[]

Adding 10 → \[10]
Adding 5 → \[10, 5]
Inserting 7 at index 1 → \[10, 7, 5]
Removing 10 → \[7, 5]
Popping last element → \[7]
Adding 20, 3, 15 → \[7, 20, 3, 15]
Sorting → \[3, 7, 15, 20]
Reversing → \[20, 15, 7, 3]

````
###  Learning Outcome

* Learn how to use **Python list methods**:
  `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.remove()`, `.pop()`, `.sort()`, `.reverse()`.
* Understand how arrays (lists) can be manipulated step by step.
* Strengthen problem-solving with **functions + array methods**.
