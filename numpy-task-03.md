# Python Task – NumPy Basics

## Task  
Write a Python program that uses **NumPy** to perform basic mathematical and array operations.

---

##  Requirements  
1. Import the **NumPy** library.  
2. Create a **NumPy array** of numbers from `1 to 10`.  
3. Perform the following operations:  
   - Find the **sum, mean, max, and min** of the array.  
   - Multiply all elements by `2`.  
   - Create a **reshaped 2D array (2x5)** from the original array.  

## Sample Output

```
Original Array: [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ]
Sum: 55
Mean: 5.5
Max: 10
Min: 1

Array multiplied by 2: [ 2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20 ]

Reshaped 2x5 Array:
[[ 1  2  3  4  5]
 [ 6  7  8  9 10]]

```
