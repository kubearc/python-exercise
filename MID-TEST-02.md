## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that simulates a simple **banking system** using **classes, objects, loops, and conditionals**.

---

## Requirements

1. Create a class `BankAccount` with:
   - Attributes: `account_holder`, `balance` (default = 0).  
   - Methods:  
     - `deposit(amount)` → adds money to balance.  
     - `withdraw(amount)` → subtracts money if sufficient balance.  
     - `check_balance()` → prints current balance.  

2. In the main program:
   - Create one `BankAccount` object.  
   - Use a **looped menu** to perform operations:  
     1. Deposit Money  
     2. Withdraw Money  
     3. Check Balance  
     4. Exit  
## 🖥 Example Run

```
--- Banking Menu ---
1. Deposit Money
2. Withdraw Money
3. Check Balance
4. Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter deposit amount: 1000
Deposited: 1000

--- Banking Menu ---
1. Deposit Money
2. Withdraw Money
3. Check Balance
4. Exit
Enter choice: 2
Enter withdrawal amount: 500
Withdrew: 500

--- Banking Menu ---
1. Deposit Money
2. Withdraw Money
3. Check Balance
4. Exit
Enter choice: 3
Current Balance: 500
```

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* ✅ Understanding **classes & objects** in Python
* ✅ Using **methods** to perform operations
* ✅ Applying **loops & conditionals** for menu-driven programs
* ✅ Handling **basic input/output** in Python
