#  Python Practice Task

## Task: Student Grade Calculator

###  Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a **function** `calculate_grade(marks)` that:
   - Takes **marks** (0–100) as input.
   - Returns the **grade** based on the following rules:
     - 90–100 → A  
     - 75–89 → B  
     - 50–74 → C  
     - Below 50 → Fail  

2. In the `main()` function:
   - Ask the user to enter a student’s name and marks.  
   - Call the `calculate_grade()` function.  
   - Print the student’s name, marks, and grade.  

---
```
###  Example Output
```

Enter student name: Alice
Enter marks: 82

Student: Alice
Marks: 82
Grade: B

````
```
###  Learning Outcome

* Understand **functions** in Python.
* Practice **if-elif-else** conditions.
* Learn how to **take user input** and display results.
